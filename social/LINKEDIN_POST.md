# LinkedIn Post - DuckDB Extensions Analysis Beta

🦆 **Just launched: DuckDB Extensions Analysis Tool (Beta)** 

After diving deep into the DuckDB ecosystem, I'm excited to share a comprehensive monitoring tool that tracks 107+ DuckDB extensions across the entire community landscape.

**What it does:**
📊 Daily automated analysis of core & community extensions  
🌐 Live dashboard with visualisations  
🔍 Health monitoring for installation URLs & GitHub activity  
📈 Tracks ecosystem growth and development trends  

**Why this matters:**
DuckDB's extension ecosystem is exploding, but navigating 100+ extensions can be overwhelming. This tool helps developers, analysts, and researchers understand what's available, what's actively maintained, and what's worth exploring.

**The numbers:**
→ 24 core extensions (built-in)  
→ 83 community extensions  
→ 50 very active projects (updated within 7 days)  
→ All tracked automatically with daily updates  

**Built with modern tools:**
Python 3.13, uv for dependencies, GitHub Actions for automation, and of course... DuckDB for the data processing! 

**It's beta** - still evolving with some rough edges, but already providing valuable insights into this rapidly growing ecosystem.
