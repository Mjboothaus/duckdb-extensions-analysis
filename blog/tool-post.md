*When I needed to understand DuckDB's extension ecosystem better, I built a monitoring tool. Here's how it works, why I made the architectural choices I did, and how you can use it to track extension compatibility.*

---

After experiencing extension compatibility issues during a DuckDB upgrade (detailed in [my previous post](@/posts/duckdb-extension-compatibility.md)), I realised there was no comprehensive way to monitor the health and status of DuckDB's extension ecosystem. So I built one. I hope others and/or the DuckDB team might find it useful.

The result is **[duckdb-extensions-analysis](https://github.com/databooth/duckdb-extensions-analysis)**—a Python tool that tracks both core and community extensions, generates multi-format reports, and provides historical analysis through a DuckDB database.

## The Problem This Solves

DuckDB's extension ecosystem is growing rapidly, but visibility into extension status is limited:

- **Core extensions** (24 total): Usually ready immediately, but occasional platform-specific delays occur
- **Community extensions** (80+ total): May lag 0-15 days behind new DuckDB releases
- **No centralised monitoring**: Information scattered across GitHub repositories, documentation, and community channels

Whether you're planning upgrades, evaluating extensions, or contributing to the ecosystem, you need current data on extension availability and health.

## What It Does

The tool provides a relatively comprehensive analysis across three key areas (improvements welcome):

### 📊 **Extension Analysis**

- **Core extensions**: Scraped from official DuckDB documentation with development stage tracking
- **Community extensions**: GitHub API analysis of all repositories in the community registry  
- **Featured extensions**: Cross-referenced with DuckDB's curated list
- **Status determination**: Active, discontinued, or error states with detailed metadata

### 📈 **Multi-Format Reporting**

- **Markdown**: Human-readable reports with data source links for verification
- **CSV**: Machine-readable data for analysis and integration
- **Excel**: Formatted spreadsheets for business reporting and sharing

### 🗄️ **Historical Tracking** 

- **DuckDB database**: All analysis stored with timestamps for trend analysis
- **Version correlation**: Extension availability linked to specific DuckDB releases
- **SQL queries**: Pre-built queries for common analysis patterns

## Architecture 

### **Core Components**
```
src/analyzers/
├── base.py              # Shared interfaces and data structures
├── github_api.py        # GitHub API client with intelligent caching
├── core_analyzer.py     # DuckDB documentation scraping
├── community_analyzer.py # Community extension analysis  
├── database_manager.py  # DuckDB persistence and querying
├── report_generator.py  # Multi-format report generation
└── orchestrator.py      # Main coordination and workflows
```

### **Key Design Choices**

**Intelligent Caching**: GitHub API responses cached to avoid rate limits while ensuring fresh data when needed. Cache bypass available for critical analysis.

**SQL File Separation**: All SQL queries extracted to `sql/` directory for better maintainability and IDE support:
```
sql/
├── 01_sequences.sql     # Create SQL
├── 02_core_extensions_history.sql
├── 03_community_extensions_history.sql
├── insert_*.sql         # Data insertion queries
└── ...
```

**Template-Based Reports**: Static content in `templates/` directory allows easy updates without code changes:
```
templates/
├── report_header.md     # Data sources and verification URLs
└── report_methodology.md # Analysis methodology
```

**Configuration Centralisation**: Single `conf/config.py` handles all settings, GitHub tokens, and dynamic versioning.

## Installation and Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.11+ 
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for task automation (optional but highly recommended)

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/databooth/duckdb-extensions-analysis.git
cd duckdb-extensions-analysis
just install  # or: uv sync

# Set up GitHub authentication (recommended to avoid rate limits)
just setup-token  # or manually create .env with GITHUB_TOKEN

# Generate comprehensive analysis
just report-all
```

## Usage Examples

The tool provides several interfaces depending on your needs:

### **Command-Line Interface**

```bash
# Basic analysis modes
just analyze core          # Core extensions only  
just analyze community     # Community extensions only
just analyze full         # Both core and community

# Report generation
just report               # Markdown report only
just report-all          # Markdown, CSV, and Excel
just report-all-fresh    # All formats with fresh data (bypass cache)

# Database operations  
just database            # Save analysis to DuckDB
just query              # Interactive database queries

# Cache management
just cache-info         # Show cache statistics
just cache-clear        # Clear all cached data
```

### **Python API**

```python
from src.analyzers.orchestrator import AnalysisOrchestrator
from conf.config import config

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = AnalysisOrchestrator(config)

# Run full analysis
result = await orchestrator.run_full_analysis()

print(f"Found {len(result.core_extensions)} core extensions")
print(f"Found {len(result.community_extensions)} community extensions")

# Generate specific report format
report_gen = ReportGenerator(config)
markdown = await report_gen.generate_markdown(result)
```

## Key Features in Detail

### **Intelligent GitHub API Usage**

- **Rate limit handling**: Automatic token detection (`.env` file or `gh` CLI)
- **Caching strategy**: Configurable cache duration to balance freshness and API limits
- **Error resilience**: Graceful handling of repository access issues

### **Data Quality Assurance**  

- **Source verification**: All data linked to authoritative sources for validation
- **Status classification**: Systematic approach to determining extension health
- **Metadata enrichment**: Repository statistics, language detection, and activity metrics

### **Historical Analysis Capabilities**

The DuckDB database enables powerful time-series analysis:

```sql
-- Track extension adoption over time
SELECT analysis_date, COUNT(*) as total_extensions 
FROM community_extensions_history 
WHERE status = '✅ Ongoing'
GROUP BY analysis_date 
ORDER BY analysis_date;

-- Identify recently inactive extensions  
SELECT name, repository, last_push_days
FROM community_extensions 
WHERE last_push_days > 90
ORDER BY last_push_days DESC;

-- Compare extension counts across DuckDB versions
SELECT duckdb_version, 
       COUNT(*) as total_extensions,
       AVG(last_push_days) as avg_days_since_update
FROM community_extensions_history 
GROUP BY duckdb_version;
```

## Output Examples

### **Analysis Summary**

```
=== Analysis Summary ===
Core Extensions: 24
Community Extensions: 80
Featured Extensions: 58
DuckDB Version: v1.4.0
Analysis Timestamp: 2025-09-19 15:18:46
```

```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### **Web Scraping Strategy**

Core extensions are scraped from DuckDB documentation using BeautifulSoup with robust error handling for HTML structure changes.

### **GitHub API Integration**

Community extensions discovered through the community-extensions repository, then individual repository metadata fetched via GitHub API with intelligent batching.

### **Performance Optimisations**

- **Concurrent processing**: Multiple extensions analysed simultaneously
- **Smart caching**: Configurable cache duration balances freshness and performance  
- **Incremental updates**: Only fetch changed data when possible

### **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
Justfile recipes work across macOS, Linux, and Windows with platform-specific commands where needed.

## Use Cases

**For Data Engineers**:

- Plan DuckDB upgrades by checking extension compatibility
- Monitor ecosystem health for dependency management
- Generate reports for technical decision-making

**For Extension Developers**:

- Track community extension adoption and activity
- Benchmark against similar extensions
- Identify maintenance patterns and best practices

**For DuckDB Contributors**:

- Monitor extension ecosystem health
- Identify extensions that may need assistance
- Track adoption of new DuckDB features across extensions

## Future Enhancements

The modular architecture makes several improvements straightforward:

- **Extension testing**: Automated compatibility testing across DuckDB versions
- **Notification system**: Alerts for extension status changes  

## Key Takeaways

The tool serves as both a practical utility for DuckDB users and a demonstration of effective data tool architecture. Whether you need immediate extension status or want to contribute to the DuckDB ecosystem, it provides the visibility needed for informed decisions.
