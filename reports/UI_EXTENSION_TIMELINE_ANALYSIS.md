### Historical Context: DuckDB v1.4.0 Release
‚ùå **UI Extension was NOT AVAILABLE**

| # | Extension | Status | Description |

### Core Extensions Count Evolution
- **Historical (v1.4.0)**: 23 core extensions (UI extension not present)
- **Current (2025-09)**: 24 core extensions (UI extension added)

## Timeline Reconstruction

Based on the available evidence:

1. **September 16, 2024**: DuckDB v1.4.0 released without UI extension
2. **Late 2024/Early 2025**: UI extension development and integration
3. **2025**: UI extension becomes available as core extension
4. **September 22, 2025**: UI extension confirmed active and documented

## Implications

This timeline demonstrates that:
- The UI extension is a **recent addition** to DuckDB's core extensions
- Applications or workflows depending on the UI extension would **not work** with DuckDB v1.4.0
- Upgrade to a newer version is required to access UI extension functionality
