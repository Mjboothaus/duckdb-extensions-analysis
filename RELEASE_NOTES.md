## üöß Beta Limitations & Known Issues

This is a beta release with known limitations that we're actively addressing:

### Data Quality
- **URL Validation**: Some false positives/negatives in broken link detection
- **Extension Categorisation**: Manual curation still needed for some edge cases
- **Historical Data**: Limited baseline for trend analysis (building over time)

### Reporting
- **Community Extension Tables**: Currently split across multiple tables, consolidation planned
- **Sorting Functionality**: Tables not yet sortable in web interface
- **Mobile Experience**: Some table layouts could be improved for smaller screens

### Technical
- **Rate Limiting**: GitHub API rate limits may occasionally delay updates
- **Performance**: Large dataset processing could be optimised further
- **Error Recovery**: Some edge cases in data collection need refinement

## üîÆ Upcoming Features (Roadmap)

### Short Term (v0.2.0)
- **Interactive Tables**: Sortable columns and filtering in web interface
- **Unified Community Table**: Merge separate community extension tables
- **Database Views**: Implement DuckDB views for easier data querying
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better resilience to API failures

### Medium Term (v0.3.0)
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical comparison and growth metrics
- **Extension Search**: Search and filter functionality
- **Performance Metrics**: Installation success rates and timing
- **Export Improvements**: Additional format support (JSON, Parquet)

### Long Term (v1.0.0)
- **Real-time Updates**: More frequent refresh capabilities
- **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable views and metrics
- **API Access**: RESTful API for programmatic access
- **Alerting System**: Notifications for extension changes
