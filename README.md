# DuckDB Extensions Analysis

A comprehensive Python tool for analysing the status and maintenance activity of DuckDB extensions, with **historical tracking**, **featured extension detection**, and **multiple export formats**.

## Overview

This project provides in-depth analysis of the DuckDB extension ecosystem:

- **Core Extensions**: Built-in extensions that are part of the main DuckDB release (24 extensions)
- **Community Extensions**: Third-party extensions maintained by the community (80+ extensions)
- **Featured Extensions**: Automatically detected featured extensions from DuckDB documentation 
- **Historical Tracking**: Complete versioned history with DuckDB version correlation

The analysis tracks repository activity, maintenance status, popularity metrics, and identifies potentially discontinued extensions with full historical context.

## Features

### üîç **Analysis Capabilities**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Examines 24 core + 80+ community extensions
- **Featured Extension Detection**: Automatically identifies ~27 featured extensions from DuckDB docs
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: Generates improved descriptions for extensions with missing/poor descriptions
- **Repository Metrics**: Stars, forks, activity levels, languages, topics, and trends
- **Status Tracking**: Identifies ongoing vs discontinued vs archived extensions

### üìä **Historical Tracking**
- **Version Correlation**: Links extension data to specific DuckDB versions
- **True Versioning**: Preserves complete historical snapshots (no data overwriting)
- **Analysis Session Tracking**: Records script version, counts, timestamps, and metadata

### ‚ö° **Performance & Reliability**
- **Async Processing**: Efficient API calls using modern async/await patterns
- **Intelligent Caching**: Configurable caching with TTL and cache bypass options
- **Retry Logic**: Robust error handling with exponential backoff
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Automatic GitHub API rate limit management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+

```

### üîç **Interactive Database Analysis**
Built-in analytics via `just query-db`:
- Analysis runs history with DuckDB version correlation
- Featured extensions ranking by popularity
- Extension activity trends and statistics  
- Historical version comparisons

## Historical Tracking & Analysis

The project includes **comprehensive historical tracking** capabilities that preserve the complete evolution of the DuckDB extensions ecosystem.

### Key Historical Features

#### üîÑ **Version Correlation**
- Every extension record includes the **DuckDB version** active at analysis time
- Enables correlation between extension ecosystem growth and DuckDB releases
- Tracks how extensions evolve with platform updates

#### üìä **True Historical Versioning** 
- Uses `INSERT` instead of `INSERT OR REPLACE` to preserve all historical data
- Each analysis run creates new records rather than overwriting existing ones
- Complete audit trail of extension ecosystem evolution

#### üéØ **Enhanced Extension Metadata**
- **Featured Flag**: Automatically detects ~27 featured extensions from DuckDB docs
- **Improved Descriptions**: Generates descriptions for extensions with missing/poor descriptions
- **Extension URLs**: Direct links to community repo, GitHub repo, installation docs
- **Repository Metrics**: Stars, forks, activity levels, languages, topics

### Database Schema

The enhanced schema includes:
- `core_extensions_history` - Historical snapshots of core extensions
- `community_extensions_history` - Historical snapshots of community extensions
- `analysis_runs` - Metadata about each analysis session
- `duckdb_releases` - DuckDB version information
- Views for current data access (`core_extensions`, `community_extensions`)

### Historical Analysis Examples

```bash
# View historical trends and analysis
just query-db

# Add simulated historical data for demonstration
just backfill-db
```

Sample queries available in the interactive analysis:
- Extension growth over DuckDB versions
- Most active extensions by time period
- Featured extension performance trends
- Extension activity level distributions

## Configuration

The scripts use several configuration constants that can be modified:

- `GITHUB_API_BASE`: GitHub API endpoint
- `COMMUNITY_REPO`: Community extensions repository
- `DUCKDB_VERSION`: Current DuckDB version for core analysis
- `HEADERS`: HTTP headers for API requests

### GitHub Rate Limits

The GitHub API has rate limits (60 requests/hour for unauthenticated requests). For better performance and to avoid rate limiting:

1. **Recommended**: Use GitHub authentication by setting the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
2. The scripts will automatically detect and use the token for authenticated requests (5000 requests/hour)
3. If you hit rate limits, the scripts will show 403 errors but will continue processing

## Development

### Code Quality

The project uses modern Python tooling:

- **ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **uv**: Fast dependency resolution and environment management

Run quality checks:

```bash
just check
# or: just format && just lint
```
