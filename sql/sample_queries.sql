-- 7. Find Extensions Similar to a Specific One (e.g., spatial extensions)
SELECT 
    name,
    extension_type,
    stars,
    description,
    repository_url
FROM extensions.all_extensions
WHERE LOWER(description) LIKE '%spatial%' 
   OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%geo%'
   OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%spatial%'
   OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%geo%'
ORDER BY stars DESC;

-- 8. Identify Potential Duplicates or Similar Extensions
WITH extension_keywords AS (

            WHEN LOWER(description) LIKE '%database%' OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%sql%' THEN 'Database'
            WHEN LOWER(description) LIKE '%file%' OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%format%' THEN 'File Format'
            ELSE 'Other'
        END as category
    FROM extensions.all_extensions
)
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) as extension_count,
    STRING_AGG(name ORDER BY stars DESC) as extensions
FROM extension_keywords
WHERE category != 'Other'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY extension_count DESC;

-- 9. Extensions That Need Attention (stale but popular)
SELECT 
    name,
    extension_type,
    stars,
    last_activity,
    description,
    repository_url
FROM extensions.all_extensions
WHERE stars > 20  -- Popular
  AND (
    last_activity LIKE '%month%' 
    OR last_activity LIKE '%year%'
    OR (last_activity LIKE '%day%' AND last_activity::INT > 90)
  )
ORDER BY stars DESC;

-- 10. Extension Ecosystem Growth Analysis (requires historical data)
-- This would work once you have time-series data
/*
WITH monthly_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', analysis_date) as month,
        COUNT(*) as total_extensions,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE extension_type = 'community') as community_extensions
    FROM historical_extensions_data 
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', analysis_date)
)
SELECT 
    month,
    total_extensions,
    community_extensions,
    total_extensions - LAG(total_extensions) OVER (ORDER BY month) as monthly_growth
FROM monthly_stats
ORDER BY month;
