## Data quality and limitations

📖 **[Full documentation]({{ metadata.links.github_repo }}/blob/main/docs/DATA_QUALITY_LIMITATIONS.md)**

**Short version:**

- Sources: DuckDB docs (core), community-extensions registry, GitHub API (repo metadata), DuckDB releases CSV + release calendar.
- This report reflects what those sources provide. Where data is missing or closed, we show that clearly.

**Known issues (what "NOT FOUND" etc. usually means):**

- Closed source: Some extensions (e.g. MotherDuck, Vortex) have no public repo.
- Moved/renamed: Upstream URLs changed after registration.
- Private: Repositories are not public yet.
- Metadata errors: Incorrect URLs in upstream data.

**Other caveats:**

- Truncated names: A few registry entries truncate repo names (e.g. query-farm/airpor). We correct known cases; some may remain until fixed upstream.
- Activity signal: "Last Activity" = last git push; stable projects may be quiet but healthy.
- Stars: Popularity signal, not usage or quality.
- Install check: Verifies INSTALL succeeds; does not exercise functionality.

**Report issues:**

- Report issues to [this analysis tool repo]({{ metadata.links.github_repo }}/issues) or directly to the specific extension's repository.
- Reporting issues here helps improve the analysis tool for everyone!
