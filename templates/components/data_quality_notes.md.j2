## Data Quality & Limitations

### About This Analysis

This report automatically aggregates data from multiple sources to provide comprehensive coverage of the DuckDB extension ecosystem. However, users should be aware of the following limitations:

#### Data Sources
- **Core Extensions**: [DuckDB Official Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/overview.html)
- **Community Extensions**: [Community Extensions Registry](https://github.com/duckdb/community-extensions)
- **Repository Metadata**: GitHub API (stars, activity, language, etc.)
- **Release Information**: [DuckDB Releases CSV](https://duckdb.org/data/duckdb-releases.csv) + [Release Calendar](https://duckdb.org/release_calendar)

#### Known Data Quality Issues

**Repository Links Showing "NOT FOUND"**:
Some extensions display `~~repository~~ NOT FOUND (HTTP 404)` messages. This typically indicates:
- **Closed-source extensions**: Some third-party extensions (e.g., MotherDuck, Vortex) are proprietary and don't have public repositories
- **Moved/renamed repositories**: Repository URLs changed after registration
- **Private repositories**: Extensions under development or with restricted access
- **Data quality issues**: Incorrect URLs in upstream metadata

These "NOT FOUND" indicators are **informative**, not errors. They accurately reflect the availability of source code.

**Truncated Repository Names**:
Some community extensions have truncated names in the upstream registry (e.g., `query-farm/airpor` instead of `Query-farm/airport`). We apply corrections where known, but some may still appear broken until fixed upstream.

**Activity Metrics**:
- "Last Activity" is based on most recent Git commit, which may not reflect maintenance for stable extensions
- Stars indicate interest but not production usage or quality
- Installation tests verify `INSTALL` command succeeds but don't test functionality

**Third-Party Extensions**:
Core extensions marked as "Third Party" may have limited documentation or support compared to extensions maintained by the DuckDB team.

#### How to Report Issues

If you notice incorrect information:
1. **For repository links**: Check if the extension has moved or is closed-source
2. **For missing extensions**: Ensure they're registered in [community-extensions](https://github.com/duckdb/community-extensions)
3. **For incorrect metadata**: Report to this project's [issue tracker]({{ metadata.links.github_repo }}/issues)

#### Best Practices

✅ **Do**: Use this report as a discovery tool and starting point  
✅ **Do**: Verify extension details in official documentation before production use  
✅ **Do**: Check individual repository READMEs for installation and usage instructions  

❌ **Don't**: Assume "NOT FOUND" means the extension doesn't work  
❌ **Don't**: Rely solely on star counts for quality assessment  
❌ **Don't**: Use activity age to judge mature, stable extensions  

### Continuous Improvement

This tool is open source and welcomes contributions to improve data quality, add new data sources, or enhance analysis capabilities. The ecosystem evolves rapidly—if you notice patterns or issues not captured here, please open an issue or pull request!
